Query processing using python, POSTGRES and MongoDb

The entire project is divided into 4 subtasks. These 4 subtasks are the four academic assignments described as below:

1. Assignment 1 was implemented using Python and POSTGRES. It contains basics partitioning queries of Distribtued Databases like Range partition and Round Robin partition.
2. Assignment 2 was again implemented using Python and POSTGRES. It consists of implementations of Rangequery and Pointquery.
3. Assignment 3 was again implemented using Python and POSTRGRES. It consists of paritioning and sorting queries like Sort partition , Range Partition, Join Partition, Parallel Sorting, and Parallel Join.
4. Assignment 5 was implemented using Python and MongoDB. Its consists of basic select and conditional queries of MongoDB.

All the above tasks were performed on existing databases of size 520 MB. Tasks were supposed to be performed in the most efficient way so that results could be evaluated as fast as possible.
